## Relational Algebra Operators
 ### Unary 
  ```sql
  SELECT (σ)
  PROJECT (π)
  RENAME (ρ)
  ```
  ### From Set Theory
  ```sql
  UNION ( U )
  INTERSECTION ( ∩ )
  CARTESIAN PRODUCT ( or / -)
  ```

  #### SELECT operation
  ```sql
  SELECT *  FROM company WHERE salary > 30000

The Algebra equivalent is

 σ<sub>salary</sub>  >  30000 (Company)
