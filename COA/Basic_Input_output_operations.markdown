- Processor intervenes in all tasks.

```
Machine instructions that can check the state of the staus flags and tranfer data

## Importance of Stack and Queue
The most common data structure used to control flow on instruction are stack and queue.

### Stack Organisation
- Memory Stack
``` 
| Program |
|         |
|         |
|  Data   |
|         |
|  Stack  |

```

## Parameter Passing by
- <b>Saving in Registers/Memory locations</b> 

## Stack frame
- The location in the stack used when subroutine running, freed when subroutine ended

- Frame pointer-to access parameters and local m/y variables
